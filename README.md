   NFT Marketplaces are now commonplace, but for auctions, most of them only offer the traditional mechanism where the auctioneer chooses a base price for the NFT and potential buyers place higher bids until finally the highest bid is approved. This is called an English Auction. OpenOcean stands out by enabling its users to choose the custom mechanism they prefer for the auction. OpenOcean currently supports the following auction schemes.
